<h1 align="center">Theory-of-Algorithms: SHA-512 Algorithm</h1>

# Repository Contents
This repository is for the purpose of the Theory of Algoirthms module GMIT. It contains:
* A working SHA-512 hash algorithm written in C which is modified from the SHA-256 hash algorithm taught in the module.
* A detailed discription including code snippets of how the algorithm works.
* Steps to download, run and test the software.
* A suite of test cases written in bash.
* Questions posed in the project brief and their researched answers.

*All relevant references are detailed at the bottom of the page.*
